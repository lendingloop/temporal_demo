LESSONS LEARNED: WHAT WORKED, WHAT DIDN'T, WHAT I'D DO DIFFERENTLY

What Worked Well:
âœ“ Start with one simple workflow, migrate incrementally
âœ“ Invest heavily in local development experience  
âœ“ Use Temporal's testing tools extensively
âœ“ Focus on business logic, let Temporal handle reliability
âœ“ Embrace the workflow-first thinking

What Was Challenging:
âš  Learning curve for distributed systems concepts
âš  Temporal server operational complexity
âš  Debugging workflows is different from debugging jobs
âš  Team needed time to adjust to new patterns

What I'd Do Differently:
ðŸ”„ More upfront investment in monitoring and observability
ðŸ”„ Better documentation of workflow patterns early
ðŸ”„ More time for team training and knowledge sharing
```

## Speaking Points (2 minutes):

**What Worked Well:**

> **Start Small:** We began with our simplest payment flow - password reset emails. Got comfortable with Temporal before tackling complex multi-currency workflows.

> **Local Development:** We invested heavily in making local Temporal development seamless. Docker Compose setup, good README, realistic test data. This paid huge dividends.

> **Testing Strategy:** Temporal's testing tools are excellent. We could unit test activities and integration test entire workflows. Much better than our old Sidekiq testing approach.

> **Workflow-First Thinking:** Once the team embraced thinking in workflows instead of jobs, everything clicked. Business processes map naturally to Temporal workflows."

**What Was Challenging:**

> **Learning Curve:** Distributed systems concepts like eventual consistency, idempotency, and compensation patterns. Not everyone on the team had this background.

> **Operational Complexity:** Running Temporal server adds operational overhead. We needed to learn about clustering, persistence, monitoring.

> **Different Debugging:** Debugging workflows is different from debugging jobs. Time-travel debugging is powerful but requires new mental models.

> **Team Adjustment:** Some developers initially missed the simplicity of 'fire and forget' background jobs. Took time to appreciate the reliability benefits."

**What I'd Do Differently:**

> **Better Monitoring:** We underestimated the importance of workflow-level monitoring. Temporal gives you execution visibility, but you need business-level dashboards too.

> **Documentation First:** We built patterns organically but should have documented them earlier. Future workflows would have been easier to implement.

> **More Training Time:** We dove into implementation quickly. More upfront training on distributed systems concepts would have helped the team.

> **Gradual Migration:** We migrated too aggressively. Should have run old and new systems in parallel longer for confidence."

**Practical Advice:**

> "If you're considering Temporal:

> **Do:** Start with a non-critical workflow. Get comfortable with the concepts before migrating business-critical processes.

> **Don't:** Try to migrate everything at once. The learning curve is real.

> **Do:** Invest in local development experience. Your team will thank you.

> **Don't:** Underestimate the operational overhead of running Temporal server.

> **Do:** Think in workflows, not jobs. Embrace the reliability patterns."

## Speaker Notes:
- Be honest about challenges and mistakes
- Give practical, actionable advice
- Balance technical and team/process insights
- Show that this wasn't a silver bullet - required work
- Emphasize the learning curve but ultimate value
- Connect to things other teams can apply
