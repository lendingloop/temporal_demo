# Slide 13: Results & Business Impact

## Visual Layout:
```
REAL RESULTS: 6 MONTHS WITH TEMPORAL

Payment Reliability:
Before: 94.2% success rate
After:  99.4% success rate  
Impact: +5.2 percentage points = $720k saved quarterly

Operational Efficiency:
Before: 3.2 hours average debug time per incident
After:  12 minutes average resolution time
Impact: 16x faster problem resolution

Developer Experience:
Before: 6.2/10 satisfaction (frequent 3am alerts)
After:  8.9/10 satisfaction (peaceful deployments)
Impact: Team actually enjoys working on payments

Business Confidence:
Before: Quarterly board meetings about payment failures
After:  Quarterly board meetings about growth opportunities
Impact: Strategic focus instead of operational firefighting
```

## Speaking Points (2.5 minutes):

**Payment Reliability:**
> "Let me share the real numbers after 6 months of running Temporal in production:

> **Payment success rate went from 94.2% to 99.4%.** That 5.2 percentage point improvement translates to $720,000 in prevented losses per quarter.

> But the success rate only tells part of the story. The failures we do have are now clean failures with automatic compensation, not the messy partial failures we used to get."

**Operational Efficiency:**
> "**Debug time dropped from 3.2 hours to 12 minutes average.** That's a 16x improvement.

> When something goes wrong now:
> - Open Temporal UI
> - See exact failure point
> - Review complete execution history
> - Understand what compensation ran
> - Done in minutes, not hours"

**Developer Experience:**
> "This might be the most important metric: **developer satisfaction went from 6.2 to 8.9 out of 10.**

> Before Temporal:
> - Developers afraid to deploy on Fridays
> - Regular 3am alerts for stuck payments
> - Hours spent debugging distributed state
> - Stress around payment system changes

> After Temporal:
> - Confident deployments any day of the week
> - Sleep through the night (alerts are rare and auto-resolve)
> - Time spent building features, not debugging
> - Excitement about working on payment infrastructure"

**Business Impact:**
> "The business impact goes beyond just technical metrics:

> **Customer satisfaction improved** because payments just work reliably.

> **Engineering velocity increased** because we spend time building instead of debugging.

> **Executive confidence grew** in our ability to scale payment processing.

> **Competitive advantage** from having bulletproof payment infrastructure."

**What This Enabled:**
> "Reliable workflows freed us to focus on what matters:
> - Multi-currency accounting features
> - International expansion planning
> - Advanced fraud detection
> - New payment methods
> - Partner integrations

> Instead of fighting fires, we're building the future."

**The Temporal Tax:**
> "Was there a cost? Yes - the 'Temporal tax':
> - Learning new patterns and concepts
> - Operational complexity of running Temporal server
> - Migration effort from existing jobs

> But the ROI was clear within 3 months. The productivity gains and reliability improvements far outweighed the learning curve."

## Speaker Notes:
- Lead with concrete numbers that matter to business
- Show improvement across multiple dimensions
- Emphasize developer experience - this audience cares about that
- Connect technical improvements to business outcomes
- Be honest about costs and learning curve
- Show how this enabled focusing on higher-value work
