[Your Name]
Senior Software Engineer, Loop Card
Ruby Meetup Toronto - [Date]

"From bundle install trauma to bulletproof payments"
```

## Speaking Points (90 seconds):

**Opening:**
> "Hi everyone, I'm [Your Name]. I've been writing Ruby for 15 years, and like many of you, I've had a love-hate relationship with this language and ecosystem."

**Personal Connection:**
> "Two months ago I had my first day at Loop Card. Guess what my onboarding task was? `bundle install`. Same errors I've been seeing for 15 years. Some things never change."

> "But here's what has changed: how we think about building reliable distributed systems. Today I want to share how we're using Temporal.io to solve real problems in Canadian fintech."

**What You'll Learn:**
> "In the next 30 minutes, I'll show you:
> - What Loop Card is building and why it matters for Canadian businesses
> - The technical challenges of multi-currency payment processing  
> - How Temporal workflows transformed our architecture
> - Real code, real numbers, and live demonstrations"

**Why This Matters:**
> "This isn't theoretical. Everything I'll show you is running in production, processing real money for real Canadian businesses. No toy examples, no contrived demos."
