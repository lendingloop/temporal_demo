LOOP CARD: SOLVING A CANADIAN BUSINESS PROBLEM

The Problem:
Canadian businesses lose 2-3% on every USD transaction
Complex accounting, unpredictable exchange rates
$965 billion in annual cross-border trade affected

The Solution:
Canada's first multi-currency corporate credit card
Spend USD, pay back USD. No conversion fees.

The Impact:
Save 3% on foreign transactions
Clean multi-currency accounting
Predictable business expenses
```

## Speaking Points (2 minutes):

**The Problem:**
> "Let me paint a picture. You're a Canadian tech startup paying for AWS, Stripe, or that critical software license from a US vendor."

> "With a traditional corporate card:
> - Pay with CAD card
> - Bank converts CAD to USD (2-3% fee)  
> - Unpredictable exchange rates affect your budget
> - Accounting nightmare: what was the actual cost?
> - For $100k annual US spending, that's $3k in unnecessary fees"

**Our Solution:**
> "Loop Card flips this around. We're Canada's first multi-currency corporate credit card."

> "Instead of: CAD card → conversion → USD payment → accounting mess
> We do: USD card → direct USD payment → pay back USD → clean books"

**Why This Matters:**
> "Canada does $965 billion in cross-border trade annually. Think about every Canadian business dealing with:
> - Tech companies paying for US SaaS
> - E-commerce businesses with international suppliers  
> - Professional services with global clients"

**The Scale:**
> "We're not just building another credit card. We're building financial infrastructure that lets Canadian businesses compete globally without bleeding money on FX."

## Speaker Notes:
- Use specific, relatable examples (AWS, Stripe)
- Quantify the problem ($3k on $100k spending)
- Show clear before/after comparison
- Use the $965B number for impact
- Position as infrastructure, not just a product
