    "settlement_currency": "USD", 
    "customer": {
      "business_name": "Toronto Tech Startup",

  }'
```

**Live Commentary:**
> "Watch the Temporal UI. You can see our workflow starting in real-time:

> - âœ… **Validation Step:** Customer credentials approved (200ms)
> - âœ… **FX Rate Step:** CAD to USD at 1.35 - rate locked for consistency  
> - âœ… **Authorization Step:** $4,050 USD pre-authorized successfully
> - ðŸ”„ **Compliance Steps:** Three checks running in parallel...
>   - Fraud Detection: Clear in 8 seconds
>   - AML Verification: Clear in 12 seconds  
>   - Sanctions Screening: Clear in 14 seconds
> - âœ… **Capture Step:** Payment successfully captured
> - âœ… **Ledger Update:** Multi-currency balances updated
> - âœ… **Notifications:** Customer and merchant notified"

**What Just Happened:**
> "Total execution: 15.3 seconds. Every step visible, traceable, and logged.

> Notice:
> - Complete audit trail of every action
> - Parallel compliance checks (45 seconds becomes 14 seconds)
> - Exchange rate locked from start to finish
> - Zero manual intervention required
> - State persisted through every step"

**The Developer Experience:**
> "This is what's different about working with Temporal:
> - I can see exactly what's happening at every moment
> - If something fails, I have complete history
> - No guessing, no log archaeology, no mystery
> - The workflow is self-documenting"

**Response:**
```json
{
  "payment_id": "pay_12345",
  "workflow_id": "loop-payment-12345-abc123", 
  "status": "completed",
  "charge_amount": 3000.00,
  "charge_currency": "CAD",
  "settlement_amount": 4050.00,
  "settlement_currency": "USD",
  "exchange_rate": 1.35,
  "execution_time": "15.3 seconds"
}
```

**Key Insights:**
> "In our old Sidekiq system, this same payment would involve:
> - 8+ separate jobs with unclear dependencies
> - No visibility if something went wrong
> - Retry logic that could cause duplicate charges
> - Manual debugging across multiple services

> With Temporal:
> - Single workflow with complete visibility
> - Automatic state management
> - Safe retry logic
> - Built-in audit trail"

## Speaker Notes:
- Keep commentary going during the demo execution
- Point out specific things happening in the Temporal UI
- Emphasize the visibility and audit trail
- Compare to what the old system would look like
- Show the JSON response with real data
- Build anticipation for the failure scenario
